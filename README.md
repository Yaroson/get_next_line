Get_Next_Line is a project which was an introduction to open/read/close functions, file descriptors and static variables.

Get_Next_Line function reads from the specified file descriptor and stores the read text in the specified string variable, one line per call.

A static string variable is used to store the remaining characters read after the first encountered new line between the calls of the function.

The function returns 1 if a line has been read, -1 in case of an error and 0 if the end of file has been reached.
It is capable of reading from multiple file descriptors simultaneously and storing the remainer on the heap for each one of those.
